### --- 1. SE1 --- ###

## 1.1. :
# Creates a sequence of numbers from the number to the left to the number
# to the right at intervals of 1, inclusive of those numbers

1:5       # returns 1 2 3 4 5
1.1:5.1   # returns 1.1 2.1 3.1 4.1 5.1

## 1.2. sample()

sample(month.name)      # returns vector with elements randomly shuffled
sample(month.name, 1)   # randomly pick 1 element out of the vector
sample(month.name, 15)  # throws an error because there are only 12 months


### --- 2. Creating vectors --- ###
# Use c()

linguists <- c("Mary Haas", "Franz Boas", "Dell Hymes")

## -- 2.1. Accessing elements within vectors -- ##

linguists[1]   # returns "Mary Haas"
               # Note in R, indexing starts at 1 (not 0)

			   
## -- 2.2. Expanding vectors -- ##

## 2.2.2. by c()

linguists <- c(linguists, "Gail Jefferson")
# reassign same vector object by concatenating extra item(s)

linguists <- c(linguists, "Roman Jakobson", "Leonard Bloomfield")

linguists  # check expanded vector

## 2.2.3. by indexing

# We know there are 6 items in the vector linguists now
# Add new item to the slot after last:

linguists[7] <- "Edward Sapir"

# Or if you don't know which slot that is ahead of time:

linguists[length(linguists) + 1] <- "Benjamen Lee Whorf"


### --- 3. Creating data frames --- ###
### data.frame()

# Let's create a second vector first:
linguistLength <- nchar(linguists)   # length of the linguists' names

d <- data.frame(linguists, linguistLength)


## -- 3.1. Accessing elements within data frames -- ##

## by column
# Since data frames are like a vector of vectors:

d[1]   # yields the first column (the linguists) as a vector
d[2]   # yields the second column (their name lengths) as a vector

# You can also access them by column name specifically, using $:

d$linguists        
d$linguistLength

## by row and column

d[1,2]  # row 1, column 2


## -- 3.2. Expanding data frames -- ##

## 3.2.1. by data.frame()

d <- data.frame(d, 1:8)   # similar to c() for expanding vectors
d   # see column added

## 3.2.2. by indexing

d[length(d)+1] <- 9:16
d   # check out column added

## 3.2.3. by $ + new column name

d$Random <- 17:24
d   # check out column added

## -- 3.3. Changing column names -- ##

colnames(d)   # returns column names of data frame d as a vector
colnames(d) <- c("Linguist", "NameLength", "Num1", "Num2", "Num3")

d   # check out changes made


### --- 4. Making a simple plot --- ###
### plot(x, y, main="", ylab="", xlab="")

plot(d$Num1,                    # x-axis data
d$NameLength,                   # y-axis data
main="Linguist Name Lengths",   # title on top
xlab="Linguist Number",         # x-axis main label
ylab="Name Length")             # y-axis main label


### --- 5. Saving your session/code --- ###

# Under "File" in the top menu

# a. Save Workspace...
# Generally NOT RECOMMENDED
# It saves all the objects you have ever created in a session, etc.
# If you've had a long session working with big pieces of data,
# that could take up a lot of memory. If you keep saving your workspace
# repeatedly and accumulate memory storage, performance of R and/or your
# computer can be affected.

# b. Save History...
# Saves all commands you have ever entered in a session

# c. Save to File...
# Saves everything as it shows on your console in a session,
# including all output of your command lines
# (but does not save plots and graphics)
